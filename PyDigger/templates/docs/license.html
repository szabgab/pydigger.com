        <h2>Adding the License field</h2>
        Adding the <b>license</b> is technically very similar to adding the <a href="author">author field</a>, but knowing what to write is a bit more challenging.
        You'll have to check what is the real license of the project. Most probably there is a file called "LICENSE" in the root of the project with the full text
        of the license. Issue <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/pydigger.com/issues/20">#20</a> call for the collection of that information.
        <p>
        Alternatively you can locate the bug-tracking system of the project (they are usually the same place the version control system can be found) and you can open
        a ticket or issue depending the word the particular system uses.
        <p>

        <h2>Shortening the license field</h2>
        We can <a href="/search?license=__long__">list package with long licenses</a> (over 50 character), but we don't have a way to list the ones that also have a VCS.
        In general it would be better to use a short and standard name for each license. That will make them more comparable.

        <h2>The technical details</h2>
        The JSON file of each package can have a field called <b>license</b> that contains the short name of the license.
        The most common way to include it in the packages is to add a field called <b>license</b> to the <b>setup</b> function in the <b>setup.py</b> of the project
        or add the same field under <b>[build-system]<b> in <b>pyproject.toml file<b>.
        <p>
        Ticket <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/pydigger.com/issues/19">#19</a> futher discusses the issues.
        Here is the section of the setup.py file:
        <pre>
        setuptools.setup(
        name="name of the project",
        version="1.1.7",
        author="Foo Bar",
        author_email="Foo.Bar.contact@Foo.com",
        <b>license="MIT"</b>
        </pre>
        Here is the section of the pyproject.toml files:
        <pre>
        [build-system]
        requires = ["poetry>=0.12"]
        build-backend = "poetry.masonry.api"
        <b>license = "Apache-2.0"</b>
        </pre>
        <h2>OSI approved licenses</h2>
        One of the goals is to make it easy to check if a package has an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI approved license</a> or not. The short names probably should
        be either the names of URLs of OSI approved licenses or  on the short names should be hosted on <a href="https://pypi.org/">PYPI</a> web site.
