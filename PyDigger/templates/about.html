        <h2>Collection process</h2>
        <p>
        Using a cron-job, we monitor the <a href="https://pypi.org/rss/updates.xml">updates.xml</a> file on PyPI. For each item we take the name, version number, description and pubDate and add the package
        to our database. Then we go over the newly added packages and try to fetch the JSON file describing them in details from <b>https://pypi.org/pypi/NAME/json</b>.
        <p>
        We extract a lot of fields from the JSON file. For example <b>maintainer</b>, <b>author</b>, <b>description</b>, <b>license</b> and many more. The <b>keywords</b> fields is split
        by comma <b>,</b> or by space <b> </b> and saved as <b>split_keywords</b>.
        </p>
        We also try to extract the link to the Version Control System (VCS) used for the development of the package. For this we rely on the <b>home_page</b> field.
        Currently, we only check if this leads to a project on GitHub.

        <h2>About</h2>
        Once upon a time there was service called <a href="https://github.com/griggheo/cheesecake">PyCheesecake</a> that measured
        certain "kwalitee" metrics of PyPI packages trying to hint at the quality of those packages.
        The idea was based on the "kwalitee" metrics of the Perl community
        offered by the <a href="http://cpants.cpanauthors.org/">CPANTS</a> service.
        <p>
        See also: <a href="https://npms.io/">npms.io</a>.
        <p>
        PyDigger has similarities, but it does not try to say one package is of higher quality than the other.
        It does not even indicate any kwalitee.
        PyDigger tries to offer a view of the Python packages on <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>.
        It provides information on "common practices" and also tries to hint at which are better
        practices or the "best practices".
        <p>
        So what kind of things do we look at?
        <p>
        In the first part of the project we look at the JSON file provided by PyPI and
        check things there. For example we check if there is a <b>license</b> and what
        that license is. Then at one point we'll recommend what kind of values should
        be in that field and what should project developers do with the other values.
        <p>
        We also look at the <b>keywords</b> that were supplied with the project.
        Having these keywords can make it easier for people to find related packages.
        On the other hand having too many keywords might be spamming the system.

        <h2>Removing a package</h2>
        Currently there is no automatic way to remove a package as that would require some trigger from pypi or that I go over all the packages once in a while to see if has been remove from pypi. If you have remove a package from pypi and would like to remove it from here as well, let me know. Either by a friendly e-mail or a friendly <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/pydigger.com">issue on the GitHub repository</a>.

        <h2>Stats</h2>
        On the <a href="/stats">stats</a> page you can see some information on various metrics. The information is extracted from the JSON file provided by PyPI, and if it has a link to the GitHub repository of the project then further data is collected from the GitHub repository.
        <h3>Version Control - GitHub</h3>
        Information about the Version Control System used for the project is extracted from the <b>home_page</b> field of the JSON file provided by PyPI. Currently it can only identify GitHub.
